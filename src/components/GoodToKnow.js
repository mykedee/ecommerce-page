                  ‚ÄúI wanted the ribbons for Christmas last year because my old
                  ones (different brand) broke. After 8 months of using it
                  several times a week, I can only say that the quality is

                  that, I really like the design! My secret highlight is the

                  mesh bag in which the bands are delivered. I always take it

                  phone, locker keys, notebook and of course the respective band
                  around individually! As the icing on the cake, I was happy to
                  be able to support the vision and dreams of the lovely power
